Hi! first and foremost thanks for buying this package! 

I strongly recommend you to read the User manual, starting with the section "Importing the package", this will allows you to set up Kinematic 2D, avoiding problems related to the layers, inputs, scripts, etc. 
Once the package is imported check the "Walkthough" section, it covers some basic aspects of the asset (Core + Implementation), features demonstration, a bunch of recommendations and side notes.

The official documentation of Kinematic 2D ("User Manual" and "Release Notes") is online (i'm using Google Docs). The reason for this is because having an online documentation allows me to update it very quickly, and you don't have to wait for the next release to get the newest version.

In the Documentation folder is included the lastest version of the User Manual in pdf version (at the moment of release).
